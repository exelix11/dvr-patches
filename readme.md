This is a set of exefs patches to allow streaming incompatible games with [sysdvr](https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR)

This is experimental and I did not test it with many games, **use at your own risk: may not work at all, cause instability and crashes or degrade performances.**

I doubt this can get you banned but again, **use at your own risk**.

## Firmware compatibility
**All firmwares starting from 11.0 should be supported, however patches must be updated with new firmwares.** 

When a new firmware is released i'll try to update this repo in a timely manner, you can check if the latest firmware is supported in the [releases tab](https://github.com/exelix11/dvr-patches/releases) or enable github notifications for this repo to get notified of updates.

Sometimes firmware updates don't need new patches, for example 14.0 uses the same ones as 14.1 because the relevant system module (am) was not changed, before opening an issue when a new firmware releases try running the patches ! 

I have no plans to port to older firmwares, of course pull requests are welcome.

## Installing
Download `dvr-patches.zip` from latest [release](https://github.com/exelix11/dvr-patches/releases) and extract it to the root of your sd card then reboot your console. Now streaming should just workâ„¢.

Every time you install a new firmware update you'll probably need to download a new version of these patches which may not be available right away, check the commit messages to know when support for a new firmware is added.

## Game compatibility
Most games seem to work fine, a few games require additional patches to work [full list here](https://github.com/exelix11/dvr-patches/issues?q=label%3A%22Fix+available%22+label%3A%22requires+patch%22) patches are provided in the thread but i offer no support for them.

A few games are not supported [full list here](https://github.com/exelix11/dvr-patches/labels/requires%20patch) if you find other games that don't work or crash open an issue, although i can't guarantee i'll be able to fix it.

If you get a crash with title id `0100000000000023` it's most likely because of this.

## Technical stuff
### What do these patches do ?
Currently only the AM sysmodule is patched, the following changes are made:
- All games that don't support recording will behave as if they have auto recording enabled in the nacp.
- All games will have screenshots enabled in the nacp.
- Am's code flow is adjusted to avoid crashing when memory allocation for auto recording fails.
- The function to block recording in certain sections of the game is stubbed .
- As a nice bonus, the function games use to load an overlay image is stubbed.
